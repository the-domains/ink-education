Our sister company, BBD Education is largely focused on the Middle East and its services include teacher recruitment, executive search and school start-ups.

BBD started business in the UAE in 2012\. Since then we have worked with schools operating English, Indian, Arab, IB and north American curricula. We can offer all-through services, from (a) feasibility analysis and financial modelling for a new school prospect, through (b) help to investors looking to acquire schools, to (c) school improvement, HR support and professional development.

Everybody in the Middle East claims to offer quality, but many of these claims are empty. We try to set standards rather than follow them. 

We have a 100% record with our Academic Plans, which are at the core of securing a school licence. We helped a client win the competition for the first two schools to be built in Qatar's new world Cup city. We have become the 'go to' advisers on school acquisitions, simply because our understanding of what makes schools work runs so deep, our networks are so strong and financial modelling is education-savvy. Too many people are selling generic tools into the education sector without understanding the business model and without knowing the benchmarks.

And we do something else that very few others do: we try to share what we know. Please get in touch with us if you would like to talk about your interests and needs. Email ralph@bbd.ae. Or andrew@bbd.ae.
